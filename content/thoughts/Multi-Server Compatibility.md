Multi-server compatibility in Minecraft plugins means making sure the plugin works smoothly across different Minecraft servers, whether they are running on the same machine or spread across multiple locations. To achieve this, a plugin needs to handle a few key areas:

1. **Modular Design:** Build the plugin in a way that allows different parts to work independently across servers. It should be flexible enough to adjust to different server types (e.g., [[Spigot]], [[Paper]], [[Velocity]]).

2. **Centralized Data Storage:** Use a shared database (like [[MySQL]]) to store player data and other important information. This ensures that all servers in the network can access the same data
   
3. **Cross-Server Communication:** If the plugin needs to send messages or perform actions across multiple servers (like BungeeCord), it should support communication between servers, such as broadcasting messages or synchronizing player actions.

4. **Server-Specific Features:** The plugin should recognize the server type (Spigot, Paper, etc.) and adjust its behavior accordingly, handling different versions or server features without issues.

5. **Permissions Syncing:** Use a centralized system for player permissions (like LuckPerms) to ensure consistency across servers, so players always have the same roles and permissions.
   
6. **Efficient Performance:** The plugin must be optimized for performance, handling multiple servers without causing slowdowns or crashes, especially when syncing data or handling events.

7. **Config Management:** Use centralized or easily synchronized configuration files, so all servers share the same settings, such as game rules or economy settings.
